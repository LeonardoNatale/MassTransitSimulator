# Mass Transit Simulator
This project was realized during the Fall 2018 term for the CS-3300 course at the Georgia Institute of Technology. 

My team and I created a Mass Transit Simulation app to be used by employees of MARTA (Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority) to allow them to create discrete-event simulations of buses, routes, and stops based on a premade dataset. We worked in teams of about 12 each, separated into "mini-teams" of 3 that worked on the Core Logic, Database, Data Analysis, and User Interface of the app. 

I was part of the Data Analysis team.
